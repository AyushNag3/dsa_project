    <h1>City Transport Network Design</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Details of Problem Space and How It Was Arrived At</h2>
        <p>Urbanization has led to increasing demands for efficient public transport systems to mitigate challenges like traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and inadequate mobility. Existing systems often fail to address issues of accessibility, affordability, and reliability, making public transport less attractive compared to private vehicles.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Summary of Findings from White Paper</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demand for Frequency:</strong> Real-time tracking and data-driven schedules improve reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Transport:</strong> Unified ticketing systems (e.g., metro-bus passes) and multimodal hubs.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability Focus:</strong> Electric and hybrid fleets reduce carbon emissions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Problem Definition and Team Details</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Definition:</strong> Design a city with a well-connected and efficient public transport network, considering factors like frequency, cost, and accessibility.</p>
